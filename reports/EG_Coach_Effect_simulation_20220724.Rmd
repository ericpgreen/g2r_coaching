# Notes

7/24/2022: 

* David modified how the simfit() function calculates the variances of the random effects based on input ICC arguments, and changed the group_rho argument to coach_group_rho, to show explicitly that the ICC for group includes the variance of group and the variance of coach in its numerator, because groups are nested in coaches (see comments in '#add random effects' section of simfit chunk).
* David added a chunk to the Design Checks section, to check the degree of crossing between the village and coach factors in the simulated data.
* David commented out a package that wouldn't install in the libraries chunk, as well as the external graphics files added to the report.

# Introduction

AVSI is interested in further exploring why coaching matters and how coaches make a difference in the lives of program participants. AVSI's key learning objective with respect to coaching is to answer the following questions:

1. In what ways is coaching important for achieving the goals of G2R?
2. What are the characteristics and practices of highly effective coaches?
3. What is the role of training, supervision, and support in the coaching model, and how can the program improve the capacity and effectiveness of coaches?

These questions have clear parallels with the literature on therapist effects in psychotherapy research. Therapist effects are defined as:

> The contribution that can be attributed to therapists when evaluating the efficacy of a psychological intervention. 

Estimated by multilevel models, therapist effects are typically represented as a percentage of the outcome variability due to therapists. We would like to estimate the 'coach effect' in the G2R model.

We propose to conduct a secondary analysis of the Cohort 1 data to estimate what percentage of variability in outcomes can be attributed to coaches. A possible limitation of this analysis is that the coach randomization was broken, but the extent to which AVSI had to deviate from the orignial assignments is not yet clear (to us at least). At a minimum, this analysis will generate new hypotheses about the influence of coaches in a setting that has very little (if any) empirical work.

# Design

In Cohort 1, village clusters were randomly assigned to treatment or control in each strata (host and refugee communities). Eligible households in each treatment village were then randomly assigned to groups of 25 households, and these groups were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 unmarked bins. A public lottery was held to assign bins to study arms. 

Separately, coaches were randomly assigned to be individual or group coaches. Individual coaches were randomly assigned to a group of 25 households in study arms 1 or 3 (individual coaching), whereas group coaches were each randomly assigned to 5 groups of 25 households in study arm 2 (group coaching). The households assigned to arm 4 were in the spillover control and did not receive the program.

# ```{r, echo=FALSE}
#   knitr::include_graphics(here::here("reports", "cohort 1 diagram.png"))
# ```

This design represents two levels of partial nesting:

1. Treatment households were nested in groups.
2. Groups were nested in coaches (also treatment only).

The nesting is **partial** because control households did not have coaches or groups. Additionally, groups were nested in village clusters but coaches were not (i.e., coaches could work with groups from different village clusters). Therefore, the design also has **crossed** random effects.

# Data Simulation

We do not have access to the data, so to illustrate a proposed approach we must first simulate trial data. 

```{r packages}
# load the necessary packages
  library(tidyverse)
  library(lme4)
  library(broom.mixed)
  library(broom.helpers)
  library(brms)
  # library(cmdstanr) # This package wouldn't install for David, so commented out
  library(tidybayes)
  library(sjPlot)
  library(specr)
  library(patchwork)
  library(modelbased)

  options("cmdstanr_write_stan_file_dir" = "cmdstanr")
```

## Model

### Simple

John and David suggested the following Stata code for a simplified model of villages assigned to treatment or control and random effects for villages and coaches. 

```
mixed y trt || _all:R.village || coach:trt, nocons reml
```

> This tells Stata that the village random effect is crossed with the coach random effect, and that the coach random effect is only in the treatment arm.

Coaches are partially nested, so John and David followed the approach of [Candlish et al. (2018)](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-018-0559-x) to code the partially nested clusters as 'singleton' clusters and (I think) fit a partially nested homoscedastic mixed effects model.

I believe the same model in `{lme4}` would be:

```
lmer(y ~ trt + (1 | village) + (0 + trt | coach))
```

where `trt` is an indicator of assignment to any treatment arm, `village` is the village code, and `coach` is the coach code. Individuals in the control arm have unique, singleton, codes for coaches since they did not have a coach.

### Actual

The actual study design was more complicated. Households in villages assigned to treatment were assigned to groups of 25, and these groups were assigned to 1 of 3 treatment arms or a spillover control arm. 

IPA estimated the following model (coefficient names changed to match this simulation):

# ```{r, echo=FALSE}
#   knitr::include_graphics(here::here("reports", "empirical.png"))
# ```

A few things to note about the IPA strategy:

1. They entered village as a fixed effect, not a random effect.
2. They accounted for the multilevel nature of the design with bootstrapping.
3. They did not include setting (host/refugee) in the model.

> To account for the two levels of randomization — village level randomization into treatment and control and household-level randomization into experimental arms within treatment villages — we construct standard errors of the parameter estimates of interest by using a bootstrap procedure that mirrors the two stages randomization process at the two different levels.

We propose to fit a mixed model and incorporate information about setting as a fixed effect:

```
lmer(y ~ coaching_individual +  # assigned to arm 1
         coaching_group +       # assigned to arm 2
         no_asset +             # assigned to arm 3
         spillover_control +    # assigned to arm 4 (no program)
         host +                 # village is in a host community (vs refugee)
         (1 | village) + 
         (0 + trt | coach) +    # trt is arm 1, 2, or 3; coaches only in trt 
         (0 + trt | group))     # all trt had some element of group structure
                                #   only coaching_group had group coaching
                                #   but arms 1 and 3 had group program elements
```

## Function

We start by defining a function that simulates the data and fits the model.

```{r simfit}

#' @param n_village_t0 participants per village, control
#' @param n_group participants per group
#' @param group_village_t1 groups per village, treatment
#' @param k_villages number of villages
#' @param village_rho village ICC
#' @param coach_rho coach ICC
#' @param coach_group_rho coach-group ICC
#' @param b_0 mean in pure control
#' @param sd standard deviation in pure control
#' @param b_ind_asset impact of individual coaching with asset transfer
#' @param b_group impact of group coaching with asset transfer
#' @param b_ind_noasset impact of individual coaching without asset transfer
#' @param b_spill spillover from T households to C households in T villages
#' @param b_host impact of host community setting (vs refugee)

This is a check of the degree to which village and coach are crossed for arm 2. I don't know if it is intended to be this way, but there is no crossing of village and coach in the host strata, and some crossing in the refugee strata.

```{r}
df %>% filter(arm == 2) %>% 
  distinct(coach, village, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  group_by(coach) %>%
  arrange(id) %>%
  add_count(name = "number_of_villages") %>%
  distinct(coach, number_of_villages) %>%
  print(n = Inf)

# Proposed Analysis

## Model

For this example, we pulled Cohort 1 endline results for the food security outcome and made up random effects for villages, coaches, and groups.

```{r, message=FALSE}
  m1 <- simfit(seed = 8675309, 
               action = "fit",
               method = "lmer",
               ci = 0.95,
               k_villages = 114,
               n_village_t0 = 40,
               group_village_t1 = 6,
               n_group = 25,
               village_rho = 0.02,     # ICC for same village
               coach_rho = 0.06,       # ICC for same coach
               coach_group_rho = 0.10, # ICC for same coach & group (see note above)
               b_0 = 0,                # mean pure control
               sd = 1,                 # sd pure control
               b_ind_asset = 0.63,
               b_group = 0.63,
               b_ind_noasset = 0.51,
               b_spill = 0.08,
               b_host = 0.20)

  tab_model(m1[[1]])
```

[The N's for coaches and groups do not represent the actual number of coaches and groups. This is because pure control and spillover control households have singleton clusters for coaches and groups, inflating the overall count.]

## Coach effect (Activity 1.1)

In the psychotherapy literature, therapist effects typically explain 5 to 8% of the variance in client outcomes. This effect can be smaller when therapist training and certification is robust and when the intervention being delivered is manualized—both factors standardize aspects of the therapeutic experience, thus reducing variability due to therapists. However, research also suggests that therapist effects may be strongest for the most severe cases.

We will define the coach effect as the coach-level ICC.

**Note that ICC for 'group' as calculated by this function represents only the variation explained by 'group' beyond the variation explained by 'coach'. Since group is nested in coach, the ICC for observations in the same group is actually the sum of the values for group and coach in this table.**

```{r}
  icc_specs(m1[[1]]) %>%
    mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 2) 
```

## Descriptive exploration of coaching variability (Activity 1.2)

We will use coach-level estimates from the multilevel model to describe and visualize coaching variability. One way to do this is to use the [`modelbased`](https://easystats.github.io/modelbased/articles/estimate_grouplevel.html) package to calculate the group-level effects for coaches.

```{r}
m1_coach <- estimate_grouplevel(m1[[1]])
m1_coach %>% as_tibble %>% arrange(desc(Coefficient)) %>%print(n=20)

m1_coach %>% as_tibble %>%
  filter(Group == "coach") %>%
  filter(!near(Coefficient, 0)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Coefficient)) +
  geom_histogram()

coach_estimates <- m1_coach %>% 
  as_tibble %>%
  filter(Group == "coach") %>%
  filter(!near(Coefficient, 0)) %>%
  arrange(Level)

coach_variations <- df %>% 
  select(coach, coach_variation) %>% unique() %>%
  arrange(desc(coach_variation))

left_join(coach_estimates, coach_variations, by = c("Level" = "coach")) %>%
  select(Level, Coefficient, coach_variation) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = coach_variation, y = Coefficient)) +
  geom_point()
  
  
  
```

Given the original model has `(0 + trt | coach)`, which is how I said coaches are only in treatment arms 1-3, I think what we get for coach is the effect of trt for each coach. Specifically, these are deviations from the effect of the intervention on food security. Coefficients close to 0 indicate that the coach's effect is close to the population-level effect. 

```{r}
  c_include <- df %>% 
    filter(trt==1) %>% 
    distinct(coach) %>% 
    pull(coach)
  
  coach_setting <- df %>%
    distinct(coach, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
    select(coach, host) %>%
    rename(Level = coach) %>%
    mutate(host = factor(host, 
                         levels = c(0, 1),
                         labels = c("Refugee", "Host")))
  
  m1_coach_r_p <- m1_coach %>% 
    filter(Group == "coach") %>%
    filter(Level %in% c_include) %>%
    left_join(coach_setting) %>%
    filter(host == "Refugee") %>%
    mutate(Level = fct_reorder(Level, Coefficient)) %>%
    visualisation_recipe(., point = list(size = .1)) %>%
    plot() +
      theme_minimal() +
      labs(x = NULL,
           title = "Refugee Community Coaches") +
      theme(axis.text.y = element_blank()) +
      ylim(-1, 1)
  
  m1_coach_h_p <- m1_coach %>% 
    filter(Group == "coach") %>%
    filter(Level %in% c_include) %>%
    left_join(coach_setting) %>%
    filter(host == "Host") %>%
    mutate(Level = fct_reorder(Level, Coefficient)) %>%
    visualisation_recipe(., point = list(size = .1)) %>%
    plot() +
      theme_minimal() +
      labs(x = NULL,
           title = "Host Community Coaches") +
      theme(axis.text.y = element_blank()) +
      ylim(-1, 1)
  
  m1_coach_h_p + m1_coach_r_p + 
    plot_annotation(
    title = 'Coach deviations from the effect of the intervention on food security',
    subtitle = "Coefficients close to 0 indicate that the coach's effect is close to the population-level effect",
    caption = 'Adjusted for arm and setting.',
    theme = theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold",
                                            size=18)))
```

# To Do

* Determine the extent to which coach randomization was broken
* Incorporate baseline data into the model.
* Set up an analysis to estimate how coach effects vary by pre-treatment severity.



```{r, eval = FALSE, include = FALSE}
df %>% filter(arm == 1) %>% select (coach) %>% unique()
df %>% filter(arm == 3) %>% select (coach) %>% unique()
df %>% filter(arm == 2) %>% select (coach) %>% unique()
```
