## Thursday ü§ù

Available for 1-on-1s or small group consultation

# [Qualitative Methods]{style="color:white; font-size:200%;"} {background="linear-gradient(0deg, #006db0, #008a2e)"}

## Goal of Qualitative Inquiry

<br>

<center>[To gain a [**deep, contextual**]{style="background-color:rgba(0, 139, 47, 0.3)"} understanding of an issue from the perspective of those involved or affected]{style="font-size:200%;"}</center>

## [Qual]{style="background-color:rgba(6, 115, 177, 0.3)"}itative [VS]{style="text-decoration: underline;"} [Quant]{style="background-color:rgba(0, 139, 47, 0.3)"}itative


| Qualitative | Quantitative |
|-------------|:-------------|
| To describe variation | To quantify variation |
| Prioritizes depth | (Often) prioritizes breadth |
| Answers why/how | Answers how much/many |
| To test hypotheses | To develop hypotheses |
| Highly flexible | Often rigid, standardized |
| Textual | Numeric |

## [Qual]{style="background-color:rgba(6, 115, 177, 0.3)"}itative [AND]{style="text-decoration: underline;"} [Quant]{style="background-color:rgba(0, 139, 47, 0.3)"}itative


| Order | Description |
|-------------|:-------------|
| Qual Ô∏é‚û°Ô∏è Quant | Measure development then validation, hypothesis generation then testing (Exploratory Sequential) |
| Quant ‚û°Ô∏è Qual | Collect qualitative data to better understand quantitative results (Explanatory Sequential) 
| Quant üîÅ Qual | Collect and analyze both types of data simultaneously and look for convergence (Convergent) |

: {tbl-colwidths="[30,70]"}

## Methods

| Method | Best For |
|-------------|:-------------|
| Interviews | Collecting personal narratives and perspectives, understanding sensitive topics |
| Focus groups | Understanding group norms, competing perspectives | 
| Participant observation | Observing naturally occurring behavior in context |

: {tbl-colwidths="[30,70]"}

# [Interviews]{style="color:white; font-size:200%;"} {background="linear-gradient(0deg, #006db0, #008a2e)"}

## Know Your Role

* The interviewer is the student, and the person being interviewed is the expert
* The goal is for the student to learn as much as the expert is willing to share about a topic
* The student poses open-ended questions, listens attentively, and probes to gain understanding

[**Key skills**]{style="font-size:200%;"}

* [rapport building]{style="color: white; background-color:rgba(6, 115, 177, 0.6);font-size:120%"}
* [emphasize other perspective]{style="color: white; background-color:rgba(6, 115, 177, 0.6);font-size:120%"}
* [adapt to personality/state]{style="color: white; background-color:rgba(6, 115, 177, 0.6);font-size:120%"}
* [active listening]{style="color: white; background-color:rgba(6, 115, 177, 0.6);font-size:120%"}

</center>

## Active Listening

| Direct Probes | Indirect Probes |
|-------------|:-------------|
| Can you say more about that? | Verbal expressions: uh huh, ok, i see |
| I'm not sure I understand. Can you explain? | Restatement: "So you are saying that‚Ä¶" |
| Can you give me an example? | Reflection: "And that made you feel‚Ä¶" |
| Why do you think..."? | Non-verbal gestures such as nodding |

## Spot the Good Interview

![](img/interview.png)

## Hot Seat üî•

For me, not you. 

I need a topic and a volunteer willing to be interviewed by yours truly. 

**Audience:** Please listen and label each direct and indirect probe I use.

## Hot Seat üî• Count the Probes

| Direct Probes | Indirect Probes |
|-------------|:-------------|
| Can you say more about that? | Verbal expressions: uh huh, ok, i see |
| I'm not sure I understand. Can you explain? | Restatement: "So you are saying that‚Ä¶" |
| Can you give me an example? | Reflection: "And that made you feel‚Ä¶" |
| Why do you think..."? | Non-verbal gestures such as nodding |

## Your Turn

Find a partner (ideally not someone who knows everything about you already).

In the first 4-min block you will interview your partner about [topic]. Don't take notes.

After the timer expires, switch roles and topics.

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 4, seconds = 00)
```

## Notetaking and Memoing

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

### [Notes]{style="color:#F4BA02"}

* What you write *in* the moment
* You need to take notes, even if you have permission to record an interview
* Use shorthand, technology
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

### [Memos]{style="color:#F4BA02"}

* What you write *after* the moment
* Memos are data
* Your observations, your questions

## Qualitative Data Analysis

* Beyond today's scope, but look into software to assist with thematic coding, such as[NVIVO](https://lumivero.com/products/nvivo/){preview-link="true"}, [ATLAS.ti](https://atlasti.com/){preview-link="true"} and [Dedoose](https://www.dedoose.com/){preview-link="true"}
* Can also use [R for text mining](https://gatesopenresearch.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/manuscripts/14107/dd817e20-3463-415f-bf6e-83cf3aae5243_12999_-_eric_green.pdf?doi=10.12688/gatesopenres.12999.1&numberOfBrowsableCollections=4&numberOfBrowsableInstitutionalCollections=0&numberOfBrowsableGateways=9){preview-link="true"}
* Large language models like [chatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) are poised to disrupt QDA. They won't replace the thinking analyst, but LLMs will quicky find patterns and themes and let analysts work more efficiently and focus on the parts that humans still do best
